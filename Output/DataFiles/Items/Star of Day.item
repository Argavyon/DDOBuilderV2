    <Description>Though seemingly made of pure gold, the blade of this bastard sword is as hard
as steel. It is also surprisingly light, able to be wielded effectively by
anyone who is proficient in the use of short swords. The clergy of the sun
god, Amaunator, have brought a number of these powerful relics to Eveningstar
in order to help combat the Darkening. Rumor and hushed whispers tell of three
blades among the Stars of Day that stand out from their bretheren, feared by
all that hide in shadow and darkness. This blade is not one of them.</Description>
