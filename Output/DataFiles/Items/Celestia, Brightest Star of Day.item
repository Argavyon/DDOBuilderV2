    <Description>This magnificent bastard sword appears to somehow have been made from a ray
of solidified light. It is nearly weightless, and despite its size, is able
to be wielded effectively by anyone who is proficient in the use of short swords.
Rumor and hushed whispers tell of three sunblades among the Stars of Day that
stand out from their brethren, feared by all that hide in shadow and darkness.
This blade is Celestia, the Brightest Star of Day.</Description>
